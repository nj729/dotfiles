❄️ Snow_Black – A Frosted Minimalist Theme for Omarchy

Snow_Black is a sleek, frosted, monochrome theme crafted exclusively for Omarchy on Arch + Hyprland.
It blends winter calmness with deep black contrast, creating a desktop experience that feels
clean, modern, and soothing—yet strikingly powerful.

Think of it as a quiet snowfall over a black metal stage:
soft, elegant, minimal… but carrying a bold visual identity.
