# Shades of Jade
Inspired by the quiet strength of jade stone — gentle greens layered over dark foundations bring calm clarity to your workspace.
The palette reflects renewal and focus, where each shade of green guides the eye yet doesn’t demand attention.
Designed to embody balance and subtle vitality — the system looks alive with purpose, not noise.
